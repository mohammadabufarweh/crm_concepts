# Solution concepts

- Solutions are the mechanism for implementing ALM in Power Apps and Power Automate.

### Application lifecycle management (ALM)

- ALM is the lifecycle management of applications, which includes governance, development, and maintenance. Moreover, it includes these disciplines: requirements management, software architecture, development, testing, maintenance, change management, continuous integration, project management, deployment, and release management. ALM tools provide a standardized system for communication and collaboration between software development teams and related departments, such as test and operations. These tools can also automate the process of software development and delivery. To that end, ALM combines the disciplines concerned with all aspects of the process to achieve the goal of driving efficiency through predictable and repeatable software delivery.



1. **Governance** includes requirements management, resource management, data security, user access, change tracking, review, audit, deployment control, and rollback.

1. **Application development** includes identifying current problems, and planning, design, building, and testing the application. This area includes traditional developer and app maker roles.

1. **Maintenance** includes deployment of the app and maintenance of optional and dependent technologies.

### ALM for Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, and Dataverse

- **Dataverse** in Microsoft Power Platform lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications.
- To use the features and tools available for ALM, all environments that participate in ALM must include a Dataverse database.
- **Solutions are the mechanism for implementing ALM; you use them to distribute components across environments through export and import. A component represents something that you can potentially customize. Anything that can be included in a solution is a component, such as site maps, apps, chatbots, entities, fields, charts, or plug-ins.**

- Dataverse stores all the artifacts, including solutions.

- Source control should be your source of truth for storing and collaborating on your components.
